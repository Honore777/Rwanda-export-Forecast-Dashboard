# Rwanda Exports Forecast Dashboard ðŸ“Š

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Rwandaâ€™s economy relies heavily on international trade, but export performance is influenced by multiple factors such as exchange rates, domestic GDP, and partner countriesâ€™ GDP.
The challenge is to build a data-driven forecasting tool that allows stakeholders to:

Anticipate future export trends

Evaluate the impact of macro-economic indicators

Support SMEs, government, and policymakers in making better trade decisions

This project was developed for the Hackathon and provides an **interactive dashboard** to analyze, forecast, and visualize Rwandaâ€™s exports using machine learning models  ectogether with macroecnomic indicators.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Data Sources
The dashboard uses multiple datasets including:
- Rwandaâ€™s exports by product categories (HS2 level) from the [Observatory of Economic Complexity (OEC)](https://oec.world/).
- Macroeconomic indicators such as:
  - Rwandaâ€™s GDP and exchange rate (historical + forecasted values).
  - Partner statesâ€™ GDP and exchange rate (using IMF forecasts and Prophet models).
- Engineered features such as **weighted GDP**, **weighted exchange rates, moving averages and rolling standard deviations**, and rolling statistical features.

---

## ðŸ”¹ What the Dashboard Communicates
The dashboard provides insights into:
- **Historical and forecasted exports** for Rwanda by product and sector or section .
- **Top exports commodities** and their trends over time(from 2018 up to 2030).
- **Partner states analysis**, including total GDP contributions and interactive maps.
- **Recommendations for SMEs, youth, and policymakers** based on forecast results and products that show potential growth.

## ðŸ”¹ User Interaction
Users can:
- Select **year ranges** via sliders in the sidebar.
- Filter by **section** (product categories) and **products**.
- View **interactive charts** (pie charts, bar charts, line charts, choropleths, bubble maps).
- Explore **tables** of predicted exports with styled formatting and there are downloadabel.
- Navigate across multiple **tabs**, such as:
  1. Home (overview)
  2. Section/Product Analysis
  3. Top Exports Commodities
  4. Recommendations
  5. Partner States Mapping
  6. Technical Details
  7.Row data

---

## ðŸ”¹ Technology Stack
- **Python**
- **Streamlit** for dashboard development
- **Plotly Express** for interactive visualizations
- **XGBoost**, **Prophet**, and **Linear Regression** for forecasting
- **Pandas** & **NumPy** for data preprocessing

---
## Purpose of the Dashboard
- Help SMEs and policymakers understand future export trends
- Highlight top export products in different years
